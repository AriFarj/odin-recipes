    <h2>Recipe Description</h2>
    <p>If you’ve ever cooked white rice and it turned out sticky, undercooked, or stuck to the bottom of the pan, you’re not alone. We’ve all been there. In fact, I used to avoid cooking rice for this very reason, chalking my failures up to not owning a rice cooker.</p>
    <p>However, since then I’ve perfected my go-to method for cooking white rice that’s fluffy, tender, and delicious every time. Plus, it just requires a saucepan and lid (no fancy rice cooker). Let me show you how it’s done.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup white rice (such as basmati or jasmine)</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        
    </ul>
